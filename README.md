*RIAD Finance — Confidential, real-time payroll infrastructure on EVM Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Robinhood Chain, and more).*

</div>

## Overview

RIAD Finance is a confidential, real-time salary streaming protocol on Arbitrum (EVM). Employers fund a private treasury, add employees with per-second salary rates, and salaries accrue autonomously via Sablier V2 LockupLinear streams. Sensitive employee compensation metrics are processed through Fhenix's confidential co-processor to keep individual salary amounts hidden from public block explorers. Employees can view their live earnings and withdraw — all with cryptographic privacy guarantees.

RIAD Finance leverages a modern EVM stack optimized for privacy and efficiency:

1. The employer deposits funds into a treasury and initiates a Sablier V2 stream for each employee.
2. Sensitive salary metrics (individual rates, totals) are encrypted and processed through Fhenix for confidential computation.
3. Events are emitted in Dune-compatible format for analytics indexing and compliance.
4. Employees claim streams directly, with optional stealth address integration (Umbra Protocol) for payment privacy.

## The Problem

### Salary Transparency Destroys Companies From the Inside
On a public blockchain, every salary is visible. When employees discover compensation gaps — even justified ones — it breeds resentment and attrition.
- Employee A discovers Employee B earns 30% more. Morale collapses.
- Top performers leave when they learn junior hires negotiated higher.
- Private bonuses become public knowledge. Everyone expects one.
- Every raise is visible — compensation becomes office gossip.

### Outsiders Can Read Your Entire Payroll
- Competitors see your burn rate and poach talent by outbidding exact salaries.
- Investors reverse-engineer your runway from payment flows.
- Bad actors identify high earners and target them.
- Every payout creates a permanent employer-to-employee link on-chain.

### Workers Earn Every Second But Get Paid Every 30 Days
Traditional payroll forces a 30-day liquidity gap. Workers generate value from minute one but only access earnings weeks later. Cross-border teams wait 3–5 days for SWIFT settlements, losing 3–7% to fees and FX spreads.

---

## Market Opportunity

The on-chain payroll market is accelerating as crypto compensation goes mainstream.

**Why now:** By 2026, stablecoin payroll has crossed the early-adopter chasm. Regulatory clarity is improving, enterprise blockchain adoption is maturing, and Gen-Z workforce expectations are shifting toward real-time, crypto-native compensation. Yet no major protocol offers true salary privacy — until Expaynse.

| Segment | Size | Pain Point |
|---------|------|------------|
| **Crypto-native companies** | 50,000+ globally | Every salary is public on-chain, exposing org charts. |
| **Remote-first teams** | 70M+ workers | 3–7% cross-border fees, 3–5 day settlement waits. |
| **Freelancer platforms** | $1.5T gig economy | 30-day payment gaps, high platform lock-in. |
| **DAOs & treasuries** | $25B+ managed | No privacy tooling for contributor payments. |

---

## Competitive Landscape

Expaynse is the only protocol that combines TEE-private salary state, per-second streaming, and private settlement. Here is how we compare:

| Protocol | Streaming | Privacy | Settlement | Chain |
|----------|-----------|---------|------------|-------|
| **Superfluid / Sablier** | Per-second | None — all public | Public transfers | EVM |
| **Zebec** | Per-second | None — all public | TradFi integration | Solana |
| **Streamflow** | Per-second | None — all public | Public transfers | Solana |
| **Expaynse** | Per-second | TEE-private state | MagicBlock private payments | Solana |

- **Superfluid / Sablier:** Great streaming primitives, but all salary data is fully public on-chain. Any explorer can see who pays whom and how much. No privacy at all.
- **Zebec:** Closest in ambition (real payroll on Solana), but focuses on TradFi compliance. Salaries are still transparent on-chain, relying heavily on centralized infrastructure.
- **Expaynse:** The privacy-first payroll protocol. TEE means salary rates and balances are computationally isolated. Private payment rails mean even the employer-employee link is obscured. Nobody else does this on Solana.

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1 — Web3 Startups & DAOs (Now)
- **Why first:** Treasuries are already on-chain, teams are crypto-native, immediate product-market fit.
- **Wedge:** "Your contributor salaries are public right now — competitors can see your entire org chart and burn rate."
- **Distribution:** Solana ecosystem partnerships, hackathon demos, developer content, DAO governance proposals.

### Phase 2 — Remote-First Companies (Next)
- **Why:** 70M+ global remote workers, cross-border payroll is painful.
- **Wedge:** "Pay your global team in seconds for <$0.01 per transaction — no SWIFT, no intermediaries."
- **Distribution:** HR/payroll platform integrations, stablecoin on-ramp partnerships.

### Phase 3 — Freelancer Platforms & Contractor Networks
- **Why:** Gig economy workers earn every second but get paid every 30 days.
- **Wedge:** "Real-time salary streaming — withdraw your earnings the moment you earn them."
- **Distribution:** Platform SDK, white-label integration for freelancer marketplaces.

### Growth Levers
- **Employee self-service UX** — Zero-config employee onboarding lowers adoption friction to near zero.
- **Privacy as a moat** — Once a company runs payroll through TEE-private streams, switching cost is high.
- **Treasury management** — Built-in deposit flows and private balance management keep CFOs engaged.

## Business Model

Expaynse generates revenue through protocol-level fees and premium SaaS services — no rent-seeking middlemen, just infrastructure that earns as it scales.

| Revenue Stream | Model |
|----------------|-------|
| **Streaming fee** | Basis points on accrued salary volume |
| **Settlement fee** | Per-withdrawal flat fee |
| **Enterprise tier** | Monthly SaaS for audit, compliance, and multi-sig support |
| **Auditor access** | Per-token compliance portal access fees |

### Unit Economics
- **Cost to serve:** Near-zero marginal cost — all heavy logic is on-chain (or in the Ephemeral Rollup), no off-chain servers to maintain beyond basic metadata (MongoDB).
- **Revenue scales with volume:** More businesses × more employees × more withdrawals = compounding protocol fees.
- **Retention Moat:** Once payroll runs through TEE-private streams, migration cost is exceptionally high.

**Why This Works:** Traditional payroll processors (ADP, Gusto, Deel) charge $6–$12 per employee per month. Expaynse's protocol fee model is 10–100× cheaper for the employer while generating sustainable revenue at scale. A single DAO with 50 contributors streaming $5K/month each = $250K monthly volume → $250–$1,250/month in protocol fees.

## Architecture

Expaynse uses a hybrid state model: On-chain Anchor programs handle permissions and state commitments, MagicBlock Ephemeral Rollups handle real-time accrual securely and privately, and a MongoDB backend indexes metadata for rapid UI rendering.

### Hybrid State Model (ER Diagram)

Our backend maps robust off-chain schemas to minimal on-chain PDAs to maintain speed, queryability, and privacy.

```mermaid

  EmployerRecord ||--o{ EmployeeRecord : "employs"
  EmployeeRecord ||--o{ PayrollStreamRecord : "has stream"
  PayrollStreamRecord ||--o{ PayrollTransferRecord : "disbursement history"
  PayrollStreamRecord ||--o{ OnChainClaimRecord : "withdrawal claims"
  
  EmployeeRecord {
    string id
    string wallet
    string employmentType
    number monthlySalaryUsd
  }
  PayrollStreamRecord {

  PayrollStreamRecord ||--|| PrivatePayrollState_PDA : "Mirrors on-chain state"
```

### PDA Derivation Map

```
Employee        → ["employee", employer_pubkey, stream_id]
PrivatePayroll  → ["private_payroll", employee_pda]
Permission      → derived via permissionPdaFromAccount(employee_pda)
```

## MagicBlock Integration

Expaynse heavily leverages the `ephemeral-rollups-sdk` (v0.11) and `magicblock-magic-program-api` (v0.8.8) to deliver its privacy and real-time promises.

### Key Design: Keeper-Free Architecture
Unlike V1 streaming protocols that rely on off-chain keeper services to update balances, Expaynse is fully on-chain and autonomous:
- **Crank-based settlements** — The MagicBlock router schedules `checkpoint_accrual` autonomously via the `schedule_checkpoint_accrual` instruction.
- **No relayer needed** — Employees sign withdrawal requests directly against the TEE state (`request_withdrawal`).
- **Private treasury** — MagicBlock ephemeral vault holds funds with private balance visibility.

### 18-Instruction On-Chain API

| Instruction | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `create_employee` | Deploy opaque PDA for employee on base layer |
| `initialize_private_payroll` | Create private state inside the ephemeral rollup |
| `pay_salary` | Settle accrued amount directly against private state |
| `checkpoint_accrual` | Tick accrued salary forward (crank-driven) |
| `request_withdrawal` | Employee-initiated claim from accrued balance (`OnChainClaimRecord`) |
| `mark_private_transfer_paid` | Settlement authority confirms off-chain payment |
| `cancel_pending_withdrawal` | Settlement authority cancels a pending claim |
| `update_private_terms` | Change rate while checkpointing accrued balance |
| `pause_stream` / `resume_stream` / `stop_stream` | Stream lifecycle control |
| `close_private_payroll` / `close_employee` | Clean up terminated streams and reclaim rent |
| `create_permission` | Grant TEE access control for employer + employee |
| `delegate_employee` | Move employee account into TEE validator |
| `commit_employee` / `undelegate_employee` | Sync state back to base layer |
| `schedule_checkpoint_accrual` | Register recurring crank via MagicBlock Magic Program |
| `cancel_checkpoint_accrual` | Cancel a scheduled crank task |

### Real-Time Streaming Flow

## Security Model

- **Wallet-based Authentication:** Every API request is authenticated via Ed25519 wallet signatures. The client signs a structured message (`wallet`, `method`, `path`, `timestamp`, `bodySha256`). The server verifies against the claimed wallet's public key to issue an HMAC session.
- **Company Key Vault:** Treasury and settlement authority keypairs are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM with a server-side encryption secret. Keys never leave the server in plaintext.
- **TEE Privacy Guarantees:** Private payroll state (rates, accrued balances, active claims) lives inside MagicBlock's TEE during active streaming. Only the employer authority and the linked employee wallet have permission-gated access.
- **Auditor Access:** Time-limited, revocable tokens grant read-only access to payroll data for compliance purposes without exposing the employer's signing authority.
- **Monthly Caps:** Configurable per-employee `monthlyCapState` prevents overpayment and drains.

---

## AI Model Routing

Expaynse now includes a server-side Gemini routing layer for Q&A and vectorization:

- `POST /api/ai/answer` uses model routing with retries:
  - `mode: \"fast\"` -> `GEMINI_FAST_MODEL` -> `GEMINI_DEFAULT_ANSWER_MODEL` -> `GEMINI_QUALITY_FALLBACK_MODEL`
  - `mode: \"default\"` -> `GEMINI_DEFAULT_ANSWER_MODEL` -> `GEMINI_QUALITY_FALLBACK_MODEL` -> `GEMINI_FAST_MODEL`
  - `mode: \"quality\"` -> `GEMINI_QUALITY_FALLBACK_MODEL` -> `GEMINI_DEFAULT_ANSWER_MODEL` -> `GEMINI_FAST_MODEL`
- `POST /api/ai/embed` uses `GEMINI_EMBED_MODEL` for embeddings.
- Both routes require wallet authorization headers/session, same as the rest of the API.

Set these environment variables in `.env`:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
GEMINI_FAST_MODEL=models/gemini-3.1-flash-lite
GEMINI_DEFAULT_ANSWER_MODEL=models/gemini-2.5-flash
GEMINI_QUALITY_FALLBACK_MODEL=models/gemini-2.5-pro
GEMINI_EMBED_MODEL=models/gemini-embedding-2
```
